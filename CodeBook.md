subject_id

        An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment
	        1,2,3 ... 30


Transformations and work that performed to clean up the data are as follows:

1. Read the whole datasets, into variables X_train, y_train,subject_train,X_test,y_test, subject_test

2. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set, by combining train and test vertically, and binding X,y and subject horizontally to create variable data_merge

3. From feature.txt, get to know which features are about the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

4. Extract the requested measurements from data_merge to create a tidy version 

5. Use descriptive activity names (which are extracted from activity_labels.txt) to name the activities in the data set, i.e., WALKING as 1, WALKING_UPSTAIRS as 2, etc.

6. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names (which are extracted from feature.txt)

7. From the data set in step 6, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject using melt and dcast function, generate variable data_melt

8. Save data for submission
